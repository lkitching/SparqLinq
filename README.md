# SparqLinq
Experimental LINQ query provider for querying RDF data.

## Running the example
The SparqLinq.Example project contains a test command line utility for demonstrating the provider. It requires a test [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) data file to be queried. An example people.ttl file is included in the root directory e.g.

```SparqLinq.Example.exe people.ttl```
